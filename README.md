# Webpack and Sass Boilerplate

I've been working on my frontend skills and I'm tired of setting this up everytime I want to start a new project.

### Commands
`npm run watch` Watches for changes in the `/src/` directory and compiles the output into `/build/`.

### SASS
The main file is the `/src/scss/styles.scss`. If you want to convert to sass, change the file name in `/src/js/styles.js`. The output file is `/build/styles.css`

### Javascript
Any Javascript file inside `/src/js/` will get bundled into `/build/app.js`
